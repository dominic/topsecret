We believe that our policy should come from below. This is not a sentimental position, but rather a strategic necessity if EBDSA is to expand beyond its current and narrow view on American political life. If we are to be an agile, flexible organization, prepared to seize our tumultuous political moment, we must be responsive to the immediate views and needs of the working class, and have clear avenues for outside perspectives to be incorporated into our own. To this end, we pledge to pursue the following three strategies:

## One

The establishment of **monthly, high-functioning General Meetings** by the end of our term

1.  These will be held at a regular time and location, such that members can plan to attend far in advance, and organizers can spend less time securing venues and turning out members.
1.  Through monthly meetings, the chapter will grow its ability to make decisions rapidly and thoughtfully, address issues urgent to the working class, and build solidarity among members by coming together regularly as a large body.
1.  These will be planned and executed by a Meetings committee, composed of a diverse group of members and leaders, with the goal of beginning within six months.

## Two

The improvement of our **website**, and the establishment of a single, effective and **democratically-controlled forum** for communication within the organization

1.  Concerning our website, we propose adding

    1.  An events calendar that allows members to submit and view unofficial events
    1.  Plain-language guides to participating in General Meetings
    1.  Templates for members to compose their own resolutions and amendments

1.  Concerning the forum, we reject dependence on corporate platforms, which thrive on acrimony, sell our data for ad money, and are clearly opposed to the goals and values of socialism. We also believe that our chapter has the technical know-how and heightened engagement to make such a forum feasible. We propose that the forum

    1.  Lower the barriers for members to reaching other members with their ideas
    1.  Be a place to organize chapter and member-driven campaigns and draw new
        members into their work
    1.  Provide a platform where members can discuss and debate politics without
        incentives for conflict and spectacle, and where members can control
        how they want to engage

## Three

**A new culture of leadership**, which embodies humility before our membership, the larger public, and our historic task. Our officers will serve as conduits and advocates for new ideas into the leadership circle, so that they might be debated openly and considered by the entire membership. To this end we pledge

1.  To grant fair hearing to ideas even if we ourselves are skeptical - in doing so, we demonstrate trust in the membership as the guiding light of the organization.
1.  To build and retain robust ties to different currents within the membership, and thereby resist the bunker mentalities and echo chambers that have rendered past socialist organizations marginal and ineffective.
1.  To fully support member-endorsed initiatives, including Medicare for All, endorsed electoral campaigns, and the brake lights program.
1.  To introduce new regulations and rules only under a high burden of necessity.
