Open EBDSA is a micro-slate of candidates for the Steering Committee of East Bay DSA, committed to fostering a true multi-tendency democracy in EBDSA. This entails collective decision making, open communication between membership and leadership, and clear avenues for new and minority views to be aired, debated and, with successful organizing on the part of their supporters, executed by our members. The slate is composed of:

* **Dominic Dagradi**, Communications Secretary
* **Aaron Hall**, At-large member

And our primary policy goals are

1.  To establish **monthly, high-functioning General Meetings** by the end of our term,
2.  To improve our website, and to build and refine a single, effective and democratically-controlled **forum for communication in the organization**, and
3.  To foster **a new culture of leadership**, and serve as a conduit and advocate for new ideas into the leadership circle so that they might be debated openly and considered by the general body.

Together, we seek to move EBDSA in the direction of greater democratic governance by the membership. This will serve members and leaders alike, smooth the tensions that have disrupted our collective work, and produce a more effective and unified force for socialist progress in the East Bay.

We do not know what that progress will look like â€“ the path to socialism cannot be plotted behind closed doors, and we look askance at those who claim to know the way. It is only through creative and public experimentation that we can move forward - this is the openness we seek. EBDSA must be open to new ideas. Our leaders must be open to member initiatives, and to voices from outside of their own experience. Our shared program must be decided in lively and open discussion. Only through such robust internal democracy will EBDSA realize its potential: to inspire the masses to collective action, to win material victories over capital, and to uphold and defend the dignity of all poor and working people.

We welcome and support all candidates who share our vision. We look forward to discussing this in more detail over the coming weeks as we publish candidate statements and supporting articles for the priorities detailed above.

In solidarity,<br>
Dominic<br>
