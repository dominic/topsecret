## By Dominic Dagradi

As we approach our first General Membership meeting with EBDSA with our new Steering Committee, I wanted to share a piece of my vision for how we grow our org. For us to become an organization made up of and embedded in working class communities, we need to be able to regularly debate, grow, learn and change to meet the needs of new voices joining our effort. Monthly general membership meetings are a critical tool to being able to effectively grow with our membership, and let our membership grow with us. Comrades Aaron H, Maia A, Andy C, David G and myself have [submitted a resolution to EBDSA's July General Meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NiNQfTtz-drLb1mDxN3ZbuscR7VAJCHN63pLT08AItQ/edit#heading=h.3qeo8dtzk0i6) instructing the chapter to begin holding monthly meetings later this year. If you're skeptical, I hope you'll vote in support of it after reading this.

Over the last year, we've made great progress for our internal democracy by adding bi-monthly membership meetings to our repertoire. These meetings have become a cornerstone of our decision making processes and invaluable in the continued running of the chapter. Originally a member-driven effort to increase democracy, transparency and engagement in the org, I am am so grateful for all the work put into these meetings across our org.

I'd like to take the time to share a vision of what our chapter would look like with monthly meetings, and why I think they are critical to our ongoing success and growth as a chapter.

## Deeper discussions, faster decisions

In the past, each meeting could best be described as an event. Every time weâ€™ve come together, weâ€™ve made critical decisions about the future of the chapter, whether it's endorsing candidates, voting on campaigns, or revising our bylaws. As we add more meetings, this has become less true, but bi-monthly meetings still create a substantial backlog of ideas and discussion for the chapter.

With regular meetings â€“ each one with fewer important decisions piled up â€“ we give room for debate without the feeling of being rushed to decide the fate of our chapter on a regular basis. Questions can be quickly put in front of membership, and feedback rapidly addressed. As an organization, we'll be able to hold richer debates spanning multiple meetings, and vote with the comfort and confidence knowing that ideas have had a chance to breathe and grow.

Every meeting we have has accomplished great things, but always go overtime and fail to finish our agenda. More time is clearly needed. And, if we even manage to get ahead of our backlog, we can begin to schedule different types of content at our meetings, such as inviting coalition partners or community members to come and speak to the chapter.

## More democratic, more inclusive

The right and ability to vote on chapter business is a critical function of being a member in this org. However, all our members have full schedules, and missing a meeting is inevitable. At our current clip, missing a proposal deadline for a meeting means having to wait at two months for the next opportunity to discuss it with membership. Being unable to attend a bi-monthly meeting in April means that a member could go from February to July without getting to debate or vote on chapter business.

With a repeatable, predictable process of meetings, and a schedule that's easy to plan around, we can spend our efforts on ways to include more of our membership in meetings. And with a stable foundation to build on, we'll free up resources to address the needs of members who don't or can't attend the meetings. Incremental improvements such as making audio streaming and live online voting available would give members at work, at home with children or who are otherwise unable to attend the ability to participate more consistently in our highest democratic body.

## More solidarity, more community

Every meeting serves multiple purposes. While we can talk at length about the importance of making decisions and doing our democratic duty, one of the most important functions served by our general meetings is the reinforcing of our chapter's community. It's widely agreed upon online interactions can quickly turn to toxicity and acrimony with tensions escalating over months. And yet still, a short, in-person interaction is frequently able to untangle and relieve those digital tensions. Just like the above gap between meetings limiting membersâ€™ ability to propose or vote if they miss one bi-monthly meeting, missing a meeting means that a member can go many months without getting to see a significant portion of their comrades face-to-face, even if theyâ€™re deeply involved in our campaigns.

Having a regular space where we come together every month helps to deepen connections and make room for in-person comradely political debate and disagreement that enriches our political culture. Additionally, it makes our chapter a regular institution in the East Bay community, giving curious folks a place to dip their toes and get a taste of what DSA is. The monthly meeting should be an exciting space for new members to show up to their first event and be awed by the breadth and quality of our work, and be inspired to jump in.

Curious how other chapters run meetings, I attended a San Francisco DSA general meeting earlier this year to see how other chapters are solving these problems. I left deeply impressed with the structure, style and tenor of their meetings.

They opened with a short presentation by a member on a socialist topic that interested them, spent some time on committee report backs from their various projects, and had a guest speaker from outside the organization speak on a topic of their expertise. The meeting then proceeded to about 40 minutes of debate on three small resolutions related to endorsements and tiny bylaws amendments, that were ably debated and quickly voted on. They finally wrapped up with open announcements from any member who wanted to get in line for the mic, giving them an opportunity to share unofficial projects they were working on in the chapter as a caucus, or just an upcoming event or cause they were passionate about.

The membership at the meeting was engaged, happy and enthusiastic. Folks disagreed on politics and left with a smile on their face. All in all, it was an experience that felt familiar while still new and electric. I'm excited to see us learn from their experience where it can benefit our chapter as well.

To their benefit, DSA SF has had the chance to practice and refine their processes over 20 individual meetings, and that polish shows. I know that on the path to realizing our untapped potential, we're going to get our hands dirty and make some mistakes. In fact, the procedural and process issues we've experienced some of our overstuffed meetings are great steps along that path, with the convention running incredibly smoothly thanks to an ever-growing Meetings Committee that is doing great work to make putting on meetings easier and more consistent. We're trying new things and learning what works and what doesn't. But our opportunities to practice are spread too thin, and hamper our membership's ability to rapidly grow as a political and deliberative body.

In [our resolution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NiNQfTtz-drLb1mDxN3ZbuscR7VAJCHN63pLT08AItQ/edit#heading=h.3qeo8dtzk0i6), we propose that we commit to monthly meetings starting in September â€“ already scheduled as a bi-monthly meeting â€“ with Octoberâ€™s meeting being the first to occur with just a month to prepare. Weâ€™ve put together plans for running cheaper, tighter meetings that engage our membership more. This isnâ€™t a magic potion to suddenly make decisions less contentious, or convince everyone to follow the same political ideology. Monthly general meetings are a place to refine our ideas and tactics, to recruit and excite brand new faces, and to promote our excellent work and events that happen between the meetings.

Iâ€™m excited to see just how much bigger and stronger our organization can grow with the addition of monthly meetings, and I hope this vision gets you fired up too. Please vote in support of monthly meetings at the [EBDSA July General Meeting](https://www.eastbaydsa.org/events/426/2018-07-14-general-membership-meeting).
