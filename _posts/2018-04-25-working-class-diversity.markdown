## By Aaron Hall

A few weeks ago, I posted both long and short-form candidate statements to the group here outlining my background and experience both inside and outside EBDSA which underscored my principles to organizing as well as my general orientation to advancing socialism in 2018 America. Doubtless, lots of have seen the website for the Open EBDSA slate which I’m part of with Dominic Dagradi and others got to hear a few of my positions at the candidate forum this past weekend. This week, I’d like to explain in a little more detail my current stances towards socialist strategy and tactics in the hopes of giving a stronger delineation of myself as a candidate. While I am running on the Open EBDSA micro-slate, the positions shared here are not official platform positions though they do relate as natural and particular extensions of them.

In this piece, I will look at how internal and external organizational character are inextricably linked, acting and reacting back on each other, using this dynamic to explore how we can firmly plant ourselves in the working class as a whole. Concretely, this means member engagement, participation, and decision-making are key to effectively expanding our reach in the working class and making progress towards socialism, and how we attempt to pursue this goal in the community determines in large part the composition and character of our organization internally. This is particularly important as the issue of recruitment and a broad and diverse base is one of the issues facing our chapter and the national.

I want to reiterate though that while I do hold certain political positions which only time will prove right or wrong, what is most important to me is the organizational capacity of our chapter, that is, the degree to which membership is active and engaged in decision-making and activities, the degree of technical skill and ability to critically reflect and analyze, and the degree of our ability to involve both prospective and new members in meaningful programs and activities which encompass areas of interest they already have. Without organizational capacity, it doesn’t matter how good or correct our ideas are -- cf. the American Left over the past half-century -- we simply will not be able to carry them out to test and refine through practice.

This is an appropriate spot to laud the level of organization of our official chapter activities to-date. They are well thought out and executed with amazing attention to detail. Data is systematically collected, all parts and roles are reviewed and practiced in advance, and debriefing occurs to evaluate how the activity went. These characteristics display a degree of seriousness and technical refinement that is necessary to any organizing endeavor. More of this, please!

There may be some that would critique this as a preoccupation with what is deemed inward-facing activity, but I contend that the healthy functioning of an organization cannot be separated from the outward-facing aim of its activity and goals. The two are inextricably linked: each area’s success affects and influences the effectiveness of the other. If the organization’s goals and actions are ineffective, irrelevant, or weak, it is of course a moot point to discuss the health of the organizational infrastructure. However, if the organization does not have the rank-and-file behind it, if they are not involved and empowered in the decision-making process or do not feel like they can effectively contribute, if their concerns, doubts, reservations, fears, scepticisms, resentments, or alienation aren’t addressed, the goals and mission of the organization cannot be achieved fully if at all <a href="#1" name="return">[1]</a>. Without much materially at stake, the importance of this dialectic can go unnoticed or become diminished in people’s minds. However, in a material struggle such as a workplace organizing drive, the importance of the participants’ mood, involvement, and engagement makes itself felt in the strongest terms possible. If these are not addressed and are allowed to proliferate, the drive will not be successful and will be torn apart by resentment and perceived hypocrisies or slowly dissipate due to alienation until it’s just a few activists crying out in the wilderness alone.

And just as an organization’s internal activities influence its ability to achieve its external goals, so do its external goals influence the character of its internal operations. Each particular activity attracts a particular type of individual. For instance, and bear with me here, the activity of soccer attracts individuals to it, either to participate or to act as spectators, who think soccer is an enjoyable activity. The individuals attracted to it operate off the shared presumption that soccer is a worthwhile activity to be engaged in because it fulfills some combination of physical, psychological, emotional, or social needs. Some individuals, though, avoid soccer not because they think it is an invalid form of activity, but because it does not fulfill some combination of their own diverse needs. If you were an organization whose goal was to get people to play sports, you could extol the virtues of soccer up and down until you were blue in the face, but it would not draw the mass of these individuals one step closer to participating in the activity or the organization for that matter.

Each group’s needs and desires are shaped by their own experiences and development in given material conditions. The people that expressed no interest in soccer have that lack of interest due to the specific social relations and conditions in which they developed as a group of individuals and those in which they currently live. If your goal were to convince the non-soccers to participate and act towards the goal of your organization of getting everyone to play sports, you would have to figure out what sport would meet their needs and then promote and offer that sport in order to get them to join. You of course wouldn’t want to stop offering and promoting soccer though as you would lose a part of your organization with which that activity resonated. Keep this in mind for later on.

As mentioned earlier, the issue of recruitment of a broad, diverse base is one of the foremost recognized issues facing our organization. Currently, though we do have segments of the working class in our organization, we do not have deep roots in the working class. We are still an organization on the whole that is disproportionately white, male, and cisgender who are materially better off than the broad majority of the rest of the class. If your notion of class was tied to income, this would be called middle class. If your notion of class was based on social relations, this would be a section of the class who tend to occupy class locations that are more contradictory in how they relate to the interests of capital and the interests of labor.

In order to sow and grow deep roots in the broad working class, we must then make sure we engage in activities that fulfill the needs of the mass of people in it. The majority of the working class is struggling to survive. Housing costs are increasing exponentially while housing quality deteriorates and displacement increases. More and more is there a reluctance to even contact the landlord or rental management company to address repairs and issues in a residence for fear that the rent will be raised or the tenants just kicked out altogether through one of the numerous legal loopholes. Wages have been stagnant for decades while prices have risen. Individuals are considered lucky if their job offers them decent hours, let alone retirement or healthcare. Primary education continues to crumble while higher education becomes further out of reach. With the increased work intensity and hours that have become the norm of decades of neoliberal policy (itself nothing more than a reassertion of the supremacy of capital), working people find themselves more exhausted and beaten and with less and less time to themselves.

This is complemented by the complete distrust of American government, the two-party system, and a lack of faith in political representatives to represent and advance the interests of working people. Accordingly, voter turnout is lower for those who make less and for people of color and while these characteristics don’t by themselves indicate an individual’s class, they do broadly correspond to it. This demonstrates less of a willingness to engage in the legislative and electoral realms of political activity by the broader working class. And rightly so, if you felt like you couldn’t change the oppressive and exploitative conditions you lived a majority of your life under -- a job that required you to always be subservient to the whims of the boss for fear of job loss, demeaned for giving your opinion at work, or discouraged by seeing others made examples of; a place of residence in which you cannot or at least feel like you cannot get problems, such as a leaky roof, broken plumbing, or rodents, addressed; constant harassment and endangerment from both the police and the crime and violence that accompany poverty -- you most likely wouldn’t think you could change the much larger and more abstract landscape of legislative or electoral politics.

Hence, while our chapter has put forward, enacted, and expanded incredibly well-run and operated canvassing programs that give people an easier activity to get plugged into and to get started with; that builds leadership through step-by-step asks of increased participation, involvement, and ownership; that teach the nuts and bolts of putting on this particular tactic and by extension principles that can be carried over to other actions and tactics; that create a support network and community based around canvassing; all of this is predicated on whether the person who wants to get involved thinks canvassing will be effective at producing the desired material change in their life. The success of such activity in the legislative and electoral realms is hard to measure -- it does not produce immediate, direct changes in living conditions, the changes it does produce often are only felt medium to long term, and a heightened sense of agency is obscured through the enormous, dispersed collective mass of energy needed to win the particular goal.

Thus, if the individual has no faith in traditional conceptions of politics to deliver and they don’t think legislative or electoral activities will actually succeed or change their life for the better in the short term, the activity as means of recruitment is a non-starter. Like the person uninterested in soccer, more often than not, no amount of encouragement or agitation will get the individual to join in the activity because the individual does not see the activity as being able to satisfy their needs. This individual is the broader working class.

The question arises then what sorts of activities will attract, engage, and empower the working class? The Bread & Roses analysis included in their platform site touches on this, but only very briefly:

> “Radical unionists in the Jim Crow South fought to integrate their unions because they knew that ‘an injury to one is an injury to all.’ The mostly white Communist Party organizers in the 1920s and the 1930s joined black activists to fight against racial terrorism and organized black sharecroppers in Alabama and black tenants’ unions in Harlem. The Black Panthers’ Fred Hampton organized working people in Chicago across racial division on the basis of shared economic grievances and against a shared enemy, the capitalist class.”

The answer to the question here is organizing based on direct material struggle. The above quote gives a few different examples of what this looks like -- labor unions, tenants’ unions, and material support (people, money, etc) to communities facing racist oppression. The fight for Medicare 4 All and against Costa-Hawkins, while appropriate points of attack against capitalism, are not direct material struggles. They are indirect and removed into the abstract legislative realm of political activity. The problem isn’t that we shouldn’t be engaged in these fights, it’s that we now need to balance them with organizing based on direct material struggle.

This is how apathetic, disillusioned, cynical people get politicized. They gain a sense of agency in effecting change in their direct lives where they experience the oppressive and exploitative system intimately and alter the character of the social relationships on which capitalism is based. From the experience of power felt from directly improving the quality of life via collective, confrontational struggle and the sense of pride, accomplishment, and organizational and relational knowledge gained from it, the working person begins to lose illusion about who is responsible for the material difficulty of their life. The working person becomes emboldened, knowing that their conditions of life are not immovable and unchangeable, no longer willing to put up with the former humiliations and deprivations. For if they were able to change their lot for the better by banding together with others occupying the same role as they, then other individuals in the same spot can change their lot by getting together to act as well. And if multiple groups can do it on that level, then what’s to stop them from organizing on an even higher level to undertake a larger struggle that gets even more to the bottom of the cause of their material want. The working person is spurred on to help and lead others down the one true path to a better life, to make bigger and bolder demands, each struggle leading itself to the larger question and the larger answer -- it is the system of relations of capitalism itself that is to blame and must be taken apart in order to be transformed.

Though it is important that those immediate short term material gains be made in order that confidence and knowledge may be acquired, what is most important here for the long term gain of the class as a whole, ie. a socialist society, is that it clearly see the class relations that subordinate it, the working class, to the capitalist class’ ability to make profits. This is in other words the gaining of class consciousness and it is this combined with the sense of agency gained through direct material struggle that enables the individual and the class to settle in and commit to the long haul of societal change. It is this determination, underscored by the trust of strong interpersonal relationships, that gives working people the courage to confront capital and disrupt its flow of accumulation. As seen in the era that produced the New Deal and the era that produced the end of legal segregation, it is the demonstrated potential and demonstrated disruption itself that forces business and the representatives of capital to give material concessions.

I want to be clear that these material struggles in and of themselves don’t guarantee that working class people will draw socialist conclusions.The conclusions drawn by the participants involved in direct struggles sans socialist viewpoint, guidance, and agitation can easily be corralled into reformist or conciliatory dead-ends. This is where the socialist party comes in and though we aren’t a socialist or even labor party just quite yet, though all of our strategy should be with this in mind, this is where DSA as a socialist organization can play a crucial role in demonstrating commitment to and developing deep relationships in the working class.

The strength of socialism is its many-sided political analysis. The extension of this to practice is a many-sided, not singular approach, to organizing. This means direct material struggle and legislative and electoral organizing. While we many not be there organizationally yet with the resources to immediately take up every important field of direct struggle, we can start taking steps to acquiring the resources and knowledge necessary to undertake this type of activity by encouraging members to organize around these struggles, by creating venues, platforms, and space for member communication, and by tending to relationships as the necessary foundation of organizing. The Labor (Sub)Committee is one already formed group that is getting off the ground but it shouldn’t be the only one with an aim of organizing around direct material issues. Spurred onto the path of class consciousness through direct material struggle, complemented and realized by socialist agitation, EBDSA can grow strong relationships and roots in the broad working class, establishing itself as a true socialist force.
